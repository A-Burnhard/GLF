        We should not be jealous and envious when someone is becoming successful through his/her own enterprise. These negative qualities are the marks of men and women with infant brains. 
        We must live longer and enjoy our God given lives to the full. Brainwashing has landed us in a strange culture, a strange land with strange behaviors. 
        Foolishly, we can only manufacture the best designing coffin and showcase them along our city streets while our natural resources – gold, diamonds, timber and many other things adorn the streets and the buildings of foreign capitals.
        We produce nothing good, positive, beautiful but only depressing coffins, our creations. We foolishly brag on the best kind of coffin to be buried in. The quality of coffin does not matter because our body is already out of use. <span class="pdf"><a href="/assets/pdfs/YOUTH-EMPOWERMENT.pdf#toolbar=0">Read More</a></span>

        </div>
        <p>
          With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering can be enormous. Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for you, the volunteer.
          We can help you to find friends, connect with the community, learn new skills, and even advance your career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving to others can also help protect your mental and physical health. It can reduce stress, combat depression, keep you mentally stimulated, and provide a sense of purpose. While it’s true that the more you volunteer, the more benefits you’ll experience, volunteering doesn’t have to
          involve a long-term commitment or take a huge amount of time out of your busy day. Giving in even simple ways can help those in need and improve your health and happiness. <span class="pdf"><a href="/assets/pdfs/VOLUNTEER-PLACEMENT.pdf#toolbar=0">Read More</a></span>

          When AIDS was first identified in 1981, health officials estimated that 5 to 10 percent, or more of those who had the virus would get the disease and die. But the virus proved to have a long incubation period. It may take five years or more for symptoms to become apparent. Now with the experience of the past eight years, 
          some officials are estimating that 40-50 percent, or more of those carrying the AIDS virus will develop the disease and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is needed is education that moves people to hate what is morally wrong, and regardless of today’s permissive views, sex outside of marriage is immoral, as is illicit drug use. These practices can lead to sickness and premature death.
  
        Yes, accepting the Creator’s standards for human behavior is the best way to avoid AIDS.
  
        "Oh, God help us control our urge and to be strong to say no to that devil of insatiable desire"
  
        Why should people die if they have known the right thing or the natural way of culture? Africa must wake up and fight the disease or ways of educating the youth of Africa.

          Public health education is crucial. Through Global Leaders Foundation, we hope to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Africa, teaching people to prevent and control the spread of HIV/AIDS 
          as well as promoting safe and healthy lifestyles. We are also looking for committed volunteers to help advocate.  <spam class="pdf"><a href="{% static 'base/assets/pdfs/HIV-AIDS-ADVOCACY.pdf#toolbar=0' %}">Read More</a></spam>

        <p>
          Exchange programs offer benefits to boost participants and host countries. For international students this is a great way to live and work in a country like Ghana.
          Whilst for the host country they benefit in brief from gaining temporary staff who usually recommend the country to family/friends and also return in the future to travel which continues to boost the economy.
          Check out the main benefits of joining a cultural exchange program in Ghana below.

    <h4>Nzulezu Stilt Village</h4>
    <div class="village-container">
      <div class="village-text">
        The spectacular scenery of stilt propped water settlement of Nzulezu built on lake Tadane located in the Jomoro District in the Western Region of Ghana stands out as a magnificent interplay between man and his environment. Nzulezu is an Nzema word meaning "surface of water." The inhabitants of the village are said to have migrated from Walata, a city in ancient Ghana Empire' the earliest of the Western Sudanese States. According to tradition, ancestors of the village were brought to their present place under the guide of a snail. The serene ambience of the surrounding landscape coupled with the general activities of life point to a dynamic relationship between man and nature. Traditional village life is adapted to the watery conditions to the amazement of the visitor. All activities pertaining to normal life chores such as pounding of fufu (a traditional meal) schooling, worship and burial are done on the lake. New born babies are baptized in the lake. The lake, it is said, averts possible disasters like outbreak of fire, 
        killing of natives of the village on or around it. The sacred day of the lake is Thursday, a day set aside on which no activity is supposed to take place signifying a strict adherence to traditional norms and taboos. 
        Nzulezu stilt settlement is a unique lacustrine habitation achieved by a harmony of forces of nature to meet man's needs resulting in a settlement of outstanding value.
